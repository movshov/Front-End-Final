# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

# Tutorials Used
For this project I ended up using quite a few different tutorials towards getting everything to work. Listed below are all of the tutorials used in this project. 

Google Map API - https://www.freakyjolly.com/google-maps-in-react-example-application/#.X8HHnRNKhJV 

Weather API - https://rapidapi.com/blog/weather-app-react/

Github Pages Deployment - https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f 

ChartJS - https://blog.bitsrc.io/customizing-chart-js-in-react-2199fa81530a 

# APIs Used
For this project I ended up using two major APIs. The first being the openweathermap API and the second being the GoogleMap API. As it turns out to make the most use out of the GoogleMap API I ended up needing to use a combination of five different APIs together.

Openweathermap API - https://openweathermap.org/

GoogleMap API - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation 
The APIs used in conjunction with the GoogleMap API are as follows: 
    * Geocoding API 
    * Geolocation API 
    * Maps Embeded API 
    * Maps Javascript API 
    * Places API
