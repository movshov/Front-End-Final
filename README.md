# Front-End-Final
By: Bar Movshovich
Class: Front End Web Technologies CS  
Term: Fall 2020
# Description:
For this project I originally was working with another partner who unfortunately had to drop the class. So instead of making a Covid restaurant finder, I created a weather app that displays the current weather given a city or latitude and longitude combination. The application then displays a dashboard of the max temperature for the next week of that given area.  

# Disclamier
Several Commits got lost in a previous project repo due to Visual Studios corrupting some of my files. The previous repo had 4 commits of setting up directories and initial files.
